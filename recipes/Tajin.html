      <li>4-6 medium-sized tomatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2-3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cup of olive oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of paprika</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon of cumin</li>
      <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Fresh parsley, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a tajine or a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add
        the chopped onion and sauté until translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the minced garlic and chopped bell peppers and continue to sauté for
        2-3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chopped tomatoes, paprika, cumin, salt, and black pepper, and
        stir everything together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the tajine or skillet and let the tomato mixture simmer for about
        15 minutes, or until the tomatoes are soft and tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the tomato mixture is cooked, use a spoon to create small wells in
        the mixture and crack an egg into each well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the tajine or skillet again and let the eggs cook in the tomato
        mixture for about 5-10 minutes, or until the whites are set and the
        yolks are cooked to your liking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley and serve hot with crusty bread or
        pita.
      </li>
    </ol>
