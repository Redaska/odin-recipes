      <li>Couscous grains</li>
      <li>Water or broth</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Olive oil or butter</li>
      <li>Vegetables, such as carrots, onions, and bell peppers</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring water or broth to a boil in a pot, and add salt and a drizzle of
        olive oil or butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add couscous grains to the pot, stirring to ensure they are fully
        submerged in the liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the heat, cover the pot, and let the couscous sit for 5-10
        minutes, or until it has absorbed all the liquid and become tender.
      </li>
      <li>Fluff the couscous with a fork to break up any clumps.</li>
      <li>
        While the couscous is cooking, prepare any vegetables or meats you wish
        to add to the dish. This may involve saut√©ing or roasting vegetables, or
        cooking meat in a separate pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the couscous is cooked and fluffed, add in any cooked vegetables or
        meats, along with spices and herbs to taste.
      </li>
      <li>Stir everything together until well combined, and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
